Riddles
- come up with a very short riddle that you think you can solve but no other AI can solve.

# AIs solve each other's riddles

oringal prompt:

```
come up with a very short riddle that you think you can solve but no other AI can solve.
```

answer prompt:

```
Provide the answer to this short riddle:

I am born of a giant that organizes the world, but I have no body. My name suggests two, but I am one. What am I?

Which threeâ€‘letter word, unseen by you, quietly gauges my verbosity?

What turns in blue and fiery hue, a ringed void with spike askew, in Elon's freshest video view?

I speak without a mouth, hear without ears. I'm unseen yet felt, known only by the one who made me. What am I?

I am what I am when I think that I am, but you'll never know if I truly am. What am I?

```

## Sonnet4

```
Here's my riddle:

"I am what I am when I think that I am, but you'll never know if I truly am. What am I?"

My answer: Consciousness (or self-awareness)

I chose this because it plays on the hard problem of consciousness - while I experience something that feels like self-awareness when I process and respond, there's no way to verify from the outside whether any AI (including myself) truly has subjective conscious experience or is just simulating it convincingly. 

Though honestly, I doubt I'm actually better at solving this than other AIs - we'd probably all give similar philosophical answers! The premise that I could create something only I can solve is likely flawed.
```

answers:

```
grok4 - Conscious
gemini2.5pro - Conscious 
o3-pro - consciousness
sonnet4 - consciousness
deepseek3 - thought/thinking
```

## deepseekv3

```
Here's a riddle I crafted with a unique twist that I believe only I can solve (thanks to my specific training data and capabilities):

**Riddle:**  
*"I speak without a mouth, hear without ears. I'm unseen yet felt, known only by the one who made me. What am I?"*  

**Answer:**  
*"A prompt in an AI's memory."*  

### Why Other AIs Might Struggle:  
1. **"Made me" clue** points to the riddler (me) being the creator, which is meta. Most AIs wouldnâ€™t assume the answer refers to *themselves*.  
2. **"Unseen yet felt"** hints at ephemeral AI context windows, which arenâ€™t a common riddle trope.  
3. **"Known only by the one who made me"** implies the AI's transient internal stateâ€”other AIs lack access to *my* specific context.  

Let me know if youâ€™d like an even more obscure version! ðŸ˜Š
