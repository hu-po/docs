stream todos:
- run cnn on lambda labs instance (maybe ssh into it beforehand to prevent keys on stream)
- get o1 to create an RNN implementation
- iterate on mutation prompts
- read through technical guide and papers
- add claude api as agent
- use voice mode with tripod as stream buddy
- custom batch sizes and aug multipliers by machine
